### Patch Changes

-   [#5330](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/pull/5330) [`7c8827b43d`](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/commit/7c8827b43d9e378818be6ee23032925c97ce02d5) Thanks [@BatuhanW](https://github.com/BatuhanW)! - chore: upgrade nock library version to ^13.4.0

    When using the Hasura provider with the 'graphql-default' naming convention, snake-case graphql operators (e.g. \_is_null) were not converted to the correct case, causing query errors.
    This problem is now fixed. Now the snake_case operator is converted according to the given naming convention (e.g. hasura-default: \_is_null, graphql-default: \_isNull).

    From the hasura documentation [here](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/schema/postgres/naming-convention/), for the graphql-default naming convention, the naming convention for enums is upper-cased. Currently the request are being made with the lowercase enum and not uppercase.

    The change mainly
    affects `sort`, desc gets changed to DESC and asc gets changed to ASC. the request from the refine client interface maintains the underscore and convertion to uppercase is only done at the API request layer.

    Previously, our Hasura data provider only supported snake-case naming conventions for operations and type names.

    Hasura recently released a setting allowing for camelCase support.

    The following changes do the Hasura data provider now support the new setting.

    All methods for the Hasura Data provider now support the camelCase `graphql-default` naming convention.

    The data provider now accepts a `namingConvention` field in the options payload.

    Ex:

    ```
    const gqlDataProvider = dataProvider(client, {namingConvention: "graphql-default"});
    ```

    If the `graphql-default` naming convention is provided, all field names and variables will be camel cased. Type names will be PascalCased.

    **Moving to the `@refinedev` scope 🎉🎉**

    Moved to the `@refinedev` scope and updated our packages to use the new scope. From now on, all packages will be published under the `@refinedev` scope with their new names.

    Now, we're also removing the `refine` prefix from all packages. So, the `@pankod/refine-core` package is now `@refinedev/core`, `@pankod/refine-antd` is now `@refinedev/antd`, and so on.

### Minor Changes

-   [#1718](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/pull/1718) [`b38620d842`](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/commit/b38620d84237e13212811daada7b49ee654c70eb) Thanks [@omeraplak](https://github.com/omeraplak)! - Add React@18 support 🚀

## 4.5.0

### Minor Changes

-   All of the refine packages have dependencies on the `@pankod/refine-core` package. So far we have managed these dependencies with `peerDependencies` + `dependencies` but this causes issues like #2183. (having more than one @pankod/refine-core version in node_modules and creating different instances)

    Managing as `peerDependencies` + `devDependencies` seems like the best way for now to avoid such issues.

## 3.25.4

### Patch Changes

-   Updated pagination parameters default values and added `hasPagination` property to `getList` method of the data providers.

    **Implementation**

    Updated the `getList` method accordingly to the changes in the `useTable` and `useList` of `@pankod/refine-core`. `hasPagination` is used to disable pagination (defaults to `true`)

    **Use Cases**

    For some resources, there might be no support for pagination or users might want to see all of the data without any pagination, prior to these changes this was not supported in **refine** data providers.
