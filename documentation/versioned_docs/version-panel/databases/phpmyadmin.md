To access phpMyAdmin click on **Databases > phpMyAdmin** link in the sidebar. You will be automatically logged into the phpMyAdmin interface where you can view all existing databases and their tables.

:::warning
Editing and manipulating tables directly from phpMyAdmin could break your site if not done correctly. If you are not comfortable doing this, please check with a developer first.
:::

Once youâ€™re logged in to phpMyAdmin, you can view your database tables, run queries, drop tables, import data, export your WordPress database, and more.

For more information about using phpMyAdmin, refer to [the official phpMyAdmin documentation](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/docs/).

:::info
phpMyAdmin runs on PHP version that user defines as [default php version](/docs/panel/advanced/server_settings#set-default-php-version) in OpenPanel. But due to phpmyadmin minimum requirements, if PHP version is less than 8.0 then the [default php version defined by the administrator](/docs/admin/settings/openpanel) will be used instead. To increase limits for the phpmyadmin interface, [edit the php.ini file](/docs/panel/advanced/server_settings#phpini-editor) of the version it is running on.
