## Introduction to Inode Usage

Inode usage is a critical aspect of managing your hosting environment. Inodes are data structures that store information about files and directories on your server. Monitoring and optimizing inode usage is vital to prevent issues related to inode limits.

## Inode Usage Chart

The Inode Usage Chart provides a visual representation of inode usage across directories. It enables you to identify areas with high inode consumption and take action as needed.

## Browsing Inodes

The "Browse Directories" section presents a table listing inodes, their associated files and directories, and their inode counts. This table allows you to navigate through inodes and assess their usage.

To explore a inodes for a specific directory, click on the directory name in the table.

To navigate to the parent directory, click on "Up One Level."

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues related to inode usage, consider these steps:
