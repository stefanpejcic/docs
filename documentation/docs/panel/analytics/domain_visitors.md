# Domain Visitors

OpenPanel uses the [goaccess](https://github.com/allinurl/goaccess) web log analyzer tool to generate visual reports for every domain from the Nginx access logs.

To view a report for a domain name simply select it from the select:

![domain_visitors_1.png](/img/panel/v1/analytics/domain_visitors_1.png)

New page will open in the browser showing the generated report.

![domain_visitors_2.png](/img/panel/v1/analytics/domain_visitors_2.png)


By default these reports are generated daily. In the top right corner you can view the timestamp when the report was last refreshed.
