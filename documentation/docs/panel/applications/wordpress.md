# WordPress Manager

![wp_manager_grid.png](/img/panel/v1/applications/wp_manager_grid.png)

WordPress Manager is a powerful tool integrated into OpenPanel, enabling you to easily install and manage WordPress websites directly from your hosting panel.

**Key Features:**
- [Single-click login to wp-admin](/docs/panel/applications/wordpress#auto-login-to-wp-admin)
- [Change DEBUG/Update preferences](https://docs.openpanel.co/docs/panel/applications/wordpress#update-preferences)
- [Backup and Restore](/docs/panel/applications/wordpress#backup-and-restore)

## Manage WordPress sites

Using the manager, you can modify WordPress settings without the need to log in to the actual website. This feature is especially handy for managing multiple websites, as you can efficiently manage options in bulk, create backups, update plugins, enable automatic WordPress core updates, enable debugging, and much moreâ€”all from the OpenPanel interface.

### WP Manager overview

On the main WP Manager page you can:

- [view installations](#): domain name, WordPress version, date when site was installed with or added to WP Manager interface and admin email.
- [refresh the data](/docs/panel/applications/wordpress#refresh-existing-data): in case you have changed the domain name, updated WordPress manually or changed admin email address.
- [install WordPress](/docs/panel/applications/wordpress#install-wordpress): install WordPress on a new domain.
- [run a scan](/docs/panel/applications/wordpress#scan-import-installations): scan for WordPress installations that were manually added on the hosting plan and are not yet visible in the WP Manager interface.
- [change view](/docs/panel/applications/wordpress#grid-vs-tabular-view): change the display from grid (default) to table.

### Install WordPress

You can quickly install any of the latest 10 WordPress versions with just a few clicks. Each WordPress installation is sourced directly from wp.org, and OpenPanel handles all additional steps, including creating a MySQL database and user, connecting it with the files, configuring the domain based on your choice of Nginx or Apache WebServer, and setting up WordPress.

To install WordPress you need to first add a domain name.

After adding a domain name, click on the 'New Website' button in the sidebar and on popup click on WordPress

![new_site_popup.png](/img/panel/v1/applications/new_site_popup.png)

Same page can be accessed by navigating to WordPress Manager and clicking on the Install button. 

In the install form set:

- Website name
- Site description (optional)
- Domain name (optionally a subfolder)
- Admin username
- Admin password
- WordPress version

and click on the 'Start Installation' button.

### Scan (Import) Installations

By performing a scan you can import existing WordPress installations into the WP Manager interface.
The tool will search all your files for wp-config.php (main WordPress configuration file) and import all websites that it finds.

### Refresh existing data

In cases when you manually updated WordPress core or changed the admin email address outside the WP Manager interface, the tool will display out-of-date information. To update the data inside the WP Manager database for your websites simply click on the 'Refresh data' button.
