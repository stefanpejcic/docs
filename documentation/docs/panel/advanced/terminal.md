# Terminal

The Web Terminal interface uses the [ttyd](https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd) tool, providing you with command-line  access from your browser.

Through this interface, you possess identical permissions as those granted by a remote SSH agent.

:::info
Due to the utilization of ttyd instead of a conventional SSH connection by the Web Terminal, this interface remains accessible even when remote SSH access is disabled for the account from the [SSH Access](/docs/panel/advanced/ssh) page.
