# OpenPanel Users

OpenPanel currently has only a single user role named **User** that can only manage their docker container and inherits settings specified by the Admin user.


## List Users

To access all OpenPanel users, navigate to OpenAdmin > Users.

The Users page displays a table showcasing each user's Gravatar linked to their email address, username, assigned IP Address, hosting plan name, creation date of the account, a login link enabling user impersonation, and an actions dropdown. In the actions dropdown, you can perform actions such as editing, suspending, or deleting the user.

![openadmin users page](/img/admin/openadmin_users_page.png)

Or from the terminal: [opencli user-list](/docs/admin/scripts/users#list-users)

Suspended users are highlighted in red, and no actions can be performed on a suspended user.

## Create Users

To create a new user, click on the 'New User' button on the Users page. A new section will be displayed with a form where you can set the email address, username, generate a strong password, and assign a hosting plan for the user.

Or from the terminal: [opencli user-add](/docs/admin/scripts/users#add-user)

## Reset User Password

## Detailed User Information

To view detailed information about the account click on the Gravatar image or the username in the users table.

This page shows detailed information about the account and provides tools to manage it.

![openadmin users single user view](/img/admin/openadmin_users_single_user_view.png)

The username is displayed at the top, along with the status of the Docker container for the user. Colors indicate whether the user is suspended or if the Docker container has encountered an error. Next to the username, there are buttons that allow you to suspend/unsuspend the user, delete the user, a configure button to edit user settings inside their Docker container, and a 'Login as user' button that automatically logs you into their OpenPanel interface.

![openadmin users single user view 1](/img/admin/user_1.png)

There are 4 widgets on top of the page:

![openadmin users single user view 2](/img/admin/user_2.png)

- **CPU Usage:** Shows the current CPU usage of all processes by the user, represented in percentage with color indicators.
- **Memory Usage:** Displays the current memory usage of the Docker container, represented in percentage with color indicators.
- **Disk Usage:** Shows the current disk usage of the user's Docker container, represented in percentage with color indicators.
- **IP Address:** Displays the public IPv4 address for the user, indicating whether the user has a Dedicated IP address assigned.

The next section is divided into two parts: tabs and widgets.

There are 6 tabs that allow you to view relevant information about the user's Docker container:

### Docker
